Single Dish Radio Astronomy Software Tools
==========================================

For an overview of SDRAST and the current status please visit https://sdrast.github.io/.

The module has functions that are specific to radio astronomy, as opposed to
astronomy in general.  They include antenna properties (beam size, efficiency,
etc.), noise power and temperature, source flux from brightness temperature,
black body radiation intensity (adopted from the Physics moduele), power unit 
conversions used in electrical engineering, etc.
